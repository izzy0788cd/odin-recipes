    <h2>Maple Salmon</h2>
    <img src="../images/maple salmon.webp" alt="Maple Salmon">
    <p>This maple glazed salmon is delicious and very easy to prepare. I love maple syrup in everything and decided to use it in the marinade. My husband totally loved it; he wasn't a salmon fan until now.</p>
    <h2>How to make Maple Salmon</h2>
    <p>This restaurant-worthy maple salmon recipe is as good as it gets! Plus, it's easy to make with simple ingredients you probably already have on hand.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
